Oh, the weather[n] outside is frightful[a] 
But the fire[n] is so delightful[a] 
And since we've no place to go[v] 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. 
It doesn't show[v] signs[n] of stopping 
And I brought me some corn[n] for popping. 
The lights[n] are turned way down low[a] 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. 
When we finally kiss[v] good-night 
How I'll hate[v] going out in the storm[n] 
But if you[p] really hold[v] me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm[a] 
And the fire[n] is slowly dying[v]  
And, my dear[a], we're still goodbyeing 
But as long as you[p] love[v] me so 
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow.
